# Go Types & Null Values

## Basic Types
Go comes with a couple of built-in basic types:

1. int => A number WITHOUT decimal places (e.g., -5, 10, 12 etc)

2. float64 => A number WITH decimal places (e.g., -5.2, 10.123, 12.9 etc)

3. string => A text value (created via double quotes or backticks: "Hello World", `Hi everyone')

4. bool => true or false

But there also are some noteworthy "niche" basic types which you'll typically not need that often but which you should still know about:

1. uint => An unsigned integer which means a strictly non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 10, 255 etc)

2. int32 => A 32-bit signed integer, which is an integer with a specific range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (e.g., -1234567890, 1234567890)

3. rune => An alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point (i.e., a single character), and is used when dealing with Unicode characters (e.g., 'a', 'ñ', '世')

4. uint32 => A 32-bit unsigned integer, an integer that can represent values from 0 to 4,294,967,295

5. int64 => A 64-bit signed integer, an integer that can represent a larger range of values, specifically from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

There also are more types like int8 or uint8 which work in the same way (=> integer with smaller number range)

## Null Values
All Go value types come with a so-called "null value" which is the value stored in a variable if no other value is explicitly set.

For example, the following int variable would have a default value of 0 (because 0 is the null value of int, int32 etc):

var age int // age is 0
Here's a list of the null values for the different types:

1. int => 0

2. float64 => 0.0

3. string => "" (i.e., an empty string)

4. bool => false

# fmt.Scan() Limitations

The fmt.Scan() function is a great function for easily fetching & using user input through the command line.

But this function also has an important limitation: You can't (easily) fetch multi-word input values. Fetching text that consists of more than a single word is tricky with this function.

For the moment, we only need single words / digits as input, so that's no problem.

Later in the course, when we work on projects where more complex input values are required, you'll therefore learn about an alternative to fmt.Scan().

# Conditional For Loops
Besides the for variations introduced in the last lectures, there also is another common variation (which will also be shown again later in the course):

```bash
for someCondition {
  // do something ...
}
```

someCondition is an expression that yields a boolean value or a variable that contains a boolean value (i.e., true or false).

In that case, the loop will continue to execute the code inside the loop body until the condition / variable yields false.
